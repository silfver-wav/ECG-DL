# ECG-DL
ECG-DL is a repository containing deep learning models for electrocardiogram (ECG) classification. The models were trained and evaluated on the PTB-XL dataset, which contains more than 21,000 ECG recordings.

## Dataset
The PTB-XL dataset used in this project can be downloaded from PhysioNet. The dataset contains 21,837 ECG recordings from 18,885 patients. Each ECG recording is a 10-second signal sampled at 500 Hz and represented as a vector of 5,000 samples. The dataset contains 71 ECG classes, including common ECG diagnoses such as myocardial infarction and arrhythmia.

# Models
The repository contains several deep learning models for ECG classification, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The models were trained and evaluated using Python and the Keras deep learning library
